Here are the software application requirements for your email automation tool.

### **Software Requirements Specification: Email Automation Tool**

---

### **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a desktop application to automate the process of sending bulk emails. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for managing recipient lists, composing emails, and sending them in batches. The intended users are employees who need to send standardized emails to multiple recipients efficiently.

---

### **2. Overall Description**

The application will be a standalone Python-based tool with a graphical user interface (GUI). It will allow users to input and save lists of 'To' and 'CC' email addresses. Users can also paste email content directly into the application, preserving the original formatting. The core functionality will revolve around sending these emails sequentially with the click of a button.

### **3. Functional Requirements**

#### **3.1 User Interface (UI)**

* **Main Window:** The application will have a single main window with three distinct sections.
* **Receiver's Email Addresses:**
    * This section will contain **24 input fields**.
    * Each field will accept a single email address.
    * The entered email addresses will be **automatically saved** and persist even after the application is closed and reopened.
* **CC Email Addresses:**
    * This section will contain **6 input fields**.
    * Each field will accept a single email address for the 'CC' (Carbon Copy) field.
    * The entered 'CC' email addresses will be **automatically saved**.
* **Email Body:**
    * This section will feature a rich text editor.
    * Users can **copy and paste content** from an external source (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Word).
    * The editor must **preserve the original formatting** of the pasted content, including but not limited to bold text, italics, underlining, bullet points, and hyperlinks.
* **Buttons:**
    * **"Send in Batch":** This button will initiate the email sending process. The application will send one email at a time to each address in the "Receiver's Email Addresses" list.
    * **"Cancel":** This button will immediately **stop the email sending process** if it is in progress.
    * **"Clear":** This button will clear all content from the "Receiver's Email Addresses," "CC Email Addresses," and "Email Body" fields.

#### **3.2 Core Functionality**

* **Email Sending:**
    * The application will integrate with Microsoft Outlook to send emails.
    * For each email in the batch, the application will:
        * Create a new email.
        * Populate the 'To' field with one email address from the receiver's list.
        * Populate the 'CC' field with all email addresses from the CC list.
        * Populate the email body with the content from the rich text editor.
        * Send the email.
* **Data Persistence:**
    * All email addresses entered in the 'To' and 'CC' fields will be automatically saved to a local configuration file.
    * When the application is launched, it will automatically load the saved email addresses into the respective fields.

---

### **4. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Platform:** The application should be developed in **Python** and be compatible with the Windows operating system.
* **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and require minimal training to operate.
* **Performance:** The application should be responsive and able to handle the sending of emails without significant delays between each email.
* **Reliability:** The application should reliably send emails to all specified recipients without errors. It should also handle potential issues gracefully (e.g., an invalid email address format).

---

### **5. Assumptions and Dependencies**

* The user will have Microsoft Outlook installed and configured on their machine.
* The user's computer will have an active internet connection to send emails.
* The application will be granted the necessary permissions to interact with Microsoft Outlook.
