Software Requirements Specification: Email Automation Tool v2.1
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a desktop application designed to automate and streamline the process of sending batch emails using Microsoft Outlook. The application provides a user-friendly, modern interface for managing recipient lists, composing emails with a consistent subject and signature, and sending them efficiently. The intended users are employees who need to send standardized communications to multiple recipients without manual repetition.

2. Overall Description
The application is a standalone Python-based tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) styled to mimic the modern Microsoft Outlook aesthetic. It allows users to input and automatically save lists of 'To' and 'CC' email addresses, as well as a default email subject.

The core functionality revolves around sending emails sequentially to each recipient. The application interfaces directly with the user's installed Microsoft Outlook client, using the default signed-in account as the sender. It automatically detects and displays the sender's email address in the UI for user confirmation. Crucially, it also automatically appends the user's default Outlook signature to every email, ensuring professional consistency.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Interface (UI)
Main Window: The application features a single main window with a clean, modern layout inspired by the new Microsoft Outlook, prioritizing the email composition area.

Receiver's Email Addresses ("To"):

This section contains 24 input fields within a scrollable pane to efficiently manage space.

Each field accepts a single email address.

CC Email Addresses ("Cc"):

This section contains 6 input fields.

Each field accepts a single email address for the 'CC' (Carbon Copy) field.

Email Subject:

A dedicated input field is provided for the email subject line.

Email Body ("Message"):

A large, rich text area is provided for composing the email message. This area is the primary focus of the UI and expands to fill available space.

Users can copy and paste content from external sources.

Sender Information Display:

A non-editable text label is displayed at the bottom of the window, showing the default sender's email address as detected from the user's Microsoft Outlook.

Buttons:

"Send in Batch": A primary-styled button that initiates the email sending process.

"Cancel": A secondary-styled button to immediately stop an in-progress sending operation.

"Clear": A secondary-styled button that, after a confirmation prompt, erases all content from the 'To', 'Cc', 'Subject', and 'Message' fields.

3.2 Core Functionality
Email Sending:

The application integrates with the user's locally installed Microsoft Outlook client.

The sender's email address is the default account configured in the user's Outlook.

For each email in the batch, the application will:

Create a new email.

Populate the 'To' field with one address from the receiver's list.

Populate the 'CC' field with all addresses from the CC list.

Populate the 'Subject' field with the text from the subject input field.

Compose the email body by placing the user's message above their default Outlook signature.

Send the email.

Sender Email Detection:

On startup, the application will automatically detect and display the email address of the default account in the user's Outlook profile.

Automatic Signature Integration:

The application will automatically detect and append the user's default signature from their Outlook settings to every outgoing email.

The formatting of the signature (including text, images, and links) will be preserved.

Data Persistence:

All email addresses ('To' and 'Cc') and the email 'Subject' will be automatically saved to a local configuration file (email_data.json).

When the application is launched, it will automatically load this saved information into the appropriate fields.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
Platform: The application is developed in Python and is compatible with the Windows operating system.

Usability & Design:

The UI is designed to be intuitive, modern, and professional, with a look and feel similar to the new Microsoft Outlook.

It uses a clean color palette, legible "Segoe UI" fonts, and clear visual hierarchy.

Performance: The application must remain responsive while sending emails in the background.

Reliability: The application must handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., Outlook not running, no accounts configured) and provide clear feedback to the user via message boxes.

5. Assumptions and Dependencies
The user must have Microsoft Outlook installed and configured on their Windows machine.

The application requires an active internet connection for Outlook to send emails.

The user's Outlook application must have a default email account set up, from which emails will be sent.
